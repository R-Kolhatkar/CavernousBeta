GAME TITLE: CAVERNOUS

RUCHA KOLHATKAR

To date, no miner has returned from the mine fabled to lead to the City of Gold. What stops the miners from ever 
leaving the cave? Fight your way through aliens summoned by the miners who opened the intergalactic portal sealed 
away in a chest, save your friend, and discover the City of Gold, all the while meeting and freeing the 
miners trapped in the depths of the cave. Go for the Gold!

GAME INSTRUCTIONS:
Upon clicking the PLAY button, you are moved along a track in the mine until you enter a portal.
Once you enter the portal, you are sent to a 2D Platformer scene in which you have to defeat at least half of the 
aliens present to unlock a portal to pass the level. Each alien has three health points, and each time you successfully 
shoot an alien, its health point total decreases by one. You can continue defeating the other aliens and collecting the 
blue diamonds even after the portal has been unlocked.
Being shot at by an alien will reduce the player's health by five points, and colliding with spikes will reduce the 
player's health by ten points. You can regain the health points by collecting the green diamonds, which will restore 
ten health points each.
If you have enough diamonds, you will be able to find out more about the alien invasion of the cave from a miner who 
has been freed because of the aliens' defeat in the 2D platformer level.
